Description: Applies dynamic structural equation models to time-series data
	with generic and simplified specification for simultaneous and lagged
	effects. Methods are described in Thorson et al. (2024)
	"Dynamic structural equation models synthesize ecosystem dynamics 
	constrained by ecological mechanisms."
