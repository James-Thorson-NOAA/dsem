\usage{
test_dsep(
  object,
  n_time = NULL,
  n_burnin = NULL,
  what = c("pvalue", "CIC", "all"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object from \code{\link{dsem}}}

\item{n_time}{how many times to include when defining the set of conditional
independence relationships. If missing, this value is taken from
the maximum lag that's included in the model plus one.}

\item{n_burnin}{how many times to include prior to \code{seq_len(n_time)} when
identifying the conditioning set that must be included when defining
conditional independence relationships.}

\item{what}{whether to just get the p-value, an information criterion
based on the conditional independence test, or a named list with these two
and other intermediate calculations (used for diagnosing test behavior)}

\item{test}{whether to test each conditional-independence relationship
using a (univariate) wald test or a (multivariate) likelihood ratio test.
The likelihood-ratio test might be more accurate given estimation covariance
and also faster (does not require standard errors), but also is not
used by phylopath and therefore less supported by previous d-dsep
testing applications.}

\item{seed}{random number seed used when simulating imputed data, so that
results are reproducible.}

\item{impute_data}{whether to independently impute missing data for each
conditional independence test, or to use imputed values from the original
fit.  The data are imputed separately for each conditional independence
test, so that they are uncorrelated as expected when combining them
using Fisher's method.  Preliminary testing suggests
that using imputed data improves test performance}
}
\value{
A p-value representing the weight of evidence that the data arises
from the specified model, where a low p-value indicates
significant evidence for rejecting this hypothesis.
}
\description{
Calculate the p-value for a test of d-separation \strong{(Experimental)}
}
\details{
A user-specified SEM implies a set of conditional independence relationships
among variables, which can be fitted individually, extracting the
slope and associated p-value, and then combining these p-values to define
a model-wide (omnibus) p-value for the hypothesis that a given data set arises
from the specified model.  This test is modified from package:phylopath.  However
it is unclear exactly how to define the set of conditional-independence assumptions
in a model with temporal autocorrelation, and the test was not developed for
uses when data are missing.  At the time of writing, the function is hightly
experimental.

Note that the method is not currently designed to deal with two-headed arrows
among variables (i.e., exogenous covariance).
