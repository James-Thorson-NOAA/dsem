\usage{
\method{simulate}{dsem}(
  object,
  nsim = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  variance = c("none", "random", "both"),
  resimulate_gmrf = FALSE,
  fill_missing = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Output from \code{\link{dsem}}}

\item{nsim}{number of simulated data sets}

\item{seed}{random seed}

\item{variance}{whether to ignore uncertainty in fixed and
random effects, include estimation uncertainty in random effects,
or include estimation uncertainty in both fixed and random effects}

\item{resimulate_gmrf}{whether to resimulate the GMRF based on estimated or
simulated random effects (determined by argument \code{variance})}

\item{fill_missing}{whether to fill in simulate all data (including values
that are missing in the original data set)}

\item{...}{Not used}
}
\value{
Simulated data, either from \code{obj$simulate} where \code{obj} is the compiled
TMB object, first simulating a new GMRF and then calling \code{obj$simulate}.
}
\description{
Simulate from a fitted \code{dsem} model
}
\details{
This function conducts a parametric bootstrap, i.e., simulates new data
conditional upon estimated values for fixed and random effects.  The user
can optionally simulate new random effects conditional upon their estimated
covariance, or simulate new fixed and random effects conditional upon their imprecision.

Note that \code{simulate} will have no effect on states \code{x_tj} for which there
is a measurement and when those measurements are fitted using \code{family="fixed"}, unless
\code{resimulate_gmrf=TRUE}.  In this latter case, the GMRF is resimulated given
estimated path coefficients
